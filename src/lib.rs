//! A crate that safely exposes arch intrinsics via `#[cfg()]`.
//!
//! `safe_arch` lets you safely use CPU intrinsics. Those things in the
//! [`core::arch`](core::arch) modules. It works purely via `#[cfg()]` and
//! compile time CPU feature declaration. If you want to check for a feature at
//! runtime and then call an intrinsic or use a fallback path based on that then
//! this crate is sadly not for you.
//!
//! SIMD register types are "newtype'd" so that better trait impls can be given
//! to them, but the inner value is a `pub` field so feel free to just grab it
//! out if you need to. Trait impls of the newtypes include: `Default` (zeroed),
//! `From`/`Into` of appropriate data types, and appropriate operator
//! overloading.
//!
//! * Most intrinsics (like addition and multiplication) are totally safe to use
//!   as long as the CPU feature is available. In this case, what you get is 1:1
//!   with the actual intrinsic.
//! * Some intrinsics take a pointer of an assumed minimum alignment and
//!   validity span. For these, the `safe_arch` function takes a reference of an
//!   appropriate type to uphold safety.
//!   * Try the [bytemuck](https://docs.rs/bytemuck) crate (and turn on the
//!     `bytemuck` feature of this crate) if you want help safely casting
//!     between reference types.
//! * Some intrinsics are not safe unless you're _very_ careful about how you
//!   use them, such as the streaming operations requiring you to use them in
//!   combination with an appropriate memory fence. Those operations aren't
//!   exposed here.
//! * Some intrinsics mess with the processor state, such as changing the
//!   floating point flags, saving and loading special register state, and so
//!   on. LLVM doesn't really support you messing with that within a high level
//!   language, so those operations aren't exposed here. Use assembly or
//!   something if you want to do that.
//!
//! ## Naming Conventions
//! The `safe_arch` crate does not simply use the "official" names for each
//! intrinsic, because the official names are generally poor. Instead, the
//! operations have been given better names that makes things hopefully easier
//! to understand then you're reading the code.
//!
//! For a full explanation of the naming used, see the [Naming
//! Conventions](crate::naming_conventions) page.
//!
//! ## Current Support
//! * `x86` / `x86_64` (Intel, AMD, etc)
//!   * 128-bit: `sse`, `sse2`, `sse3`, `ssse3`, `sse4.1`, `sse4.2`
//!   * 256-bit: `avx`, `avx2`
//!   * Other: `adx`, `aes`, `bmi1`, `bmi2`, `fma`, `lzcnt`, `pclmulqdq`,
//!     `popcnt`, `rdrand`, `rdseed`
//!
//! ## Compile Time CPU Target Features
//!
//! At the time of me writing this, Rust enables the `sse` and `sse2` CPU
//! features by default for all `i686` (x86) and `x86_64` builds. Those CPU
//! features are built into the design of `x86_64`, and you'd need a _super_ old
//! `x86` CPU for it to not support at least `sse` and `sse2`, so they're a safe
//! bet for the language to enable all the time. In fact, because the standard
//! library is compiled with them enabled, simply trying to _disable_ those
//! features would actually cause ABI issues and fill your program with UB
//! ([link][rustc_docs]).
//!
//! If you want additional CPU features available at compile time you'll have to
//! enable them with an additional arg to `rustc`. For a feature named `name`
//! you pass `-C target-feature=+name`, such as `-C target-feature=+sse3` for
//! `sse3`.
//!
//! You can alternately enable _all_ target features of the current CPU with `-C
//! target-cpu=native`. This is primarily of use if you're building a program
//! you'll only run on your own system.
//!
//! It's sometimes hard to know if your target platform will support a given
//! feature set, but the [Steam Hardware Survey][steam-survey] is generally
//! taken as a guide to what you can expect people to have available. If you
//! click "Other Settings" it'll expand into a list of CPU target features and
//! how common they are. These days, it seems that `sse3` can be safely assumed,
//! and `ssse3`, `sse4.1`, and `sse4.2` are pretty safe bets as well. The stuff
//! above 128-bit isn't as common yet, give it another few years.
//!
//! **Please note that executing a program on a CPU that doesn't support the
//! target features it was compiles for is Undefined Behavior.**
//!
//! Currently, Rust doesn't actually support an easy way for you to check that a
//! feature enabled at compile time is _actually_ available at runtime. There is
//! the "[feature_detected][feature_detected]" family of macros, but if you
//! enable a feature they will evaluate to a constant `true` instead of actually
//! deferring the check for the feature to runtime. This means that, if you
//! _did_ want a check at the start of your program, to confirm that all the
//! assumed features are present and error out when the assumptions don't hold,
//! you can't use that macro. You gotta use CPUID and check manually. rip.
//! Hopefully we can make that process easier in a future version of this crate.

//!
//! ### A Note On Working With Cfg
//!
//! There's two main ways to use `cfg`:
//! * Via an attribute placed on an item, block, or expression:
//!   * `#[cfg(debug_assertions)] println!("hello");`
//! * Via a macro used within an expression position:
//!   * `if cfg!(debug_assertions) { println!("hello"); }`
//!
//! The difference might seem small but it's actually very important:
//! * The attribute form will include code or not _before_ deciding if all the
//!   items named and so forth really exist or not. This means that code that is
//!   configured via attribute can safely name things that don't always exist as
//!   long as the things they name do exist whenever that code is configured
//!   into the build.
//! * The macro form will include the configured code _no matter what_, and then
//!   the macro resolves to a constant `true` or `false` and the compiler uses
//!   dead code elimination to cut out the path not taken.
//!
//! This crate uses `cfg` via the attribute, so the functions it exposes don't
//! exist at all when the appropriate CPU target features aren't enabled.
//! Accordingly, if you plan to call this crate or not depending on what
//! features are enabled in the build you'll also need to control your use of
//! this crate via cfg attribute, not cfg macro.
