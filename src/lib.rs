//! A crate that safely exposes arch intrinsics via `#[cfg()]`.
//!
//! `safe_arch` lets you safely use CPU intrinsics. Those things in the
//! [`core::arch`](core::arch) modules. It works purely via `#[cfg()]` and
//! compile time CPU feature declaration. If you want to check for a feature at
//! runtime and then call an intrinsic or use a fallback path based on that then
//! this crate is sadly not for you.
//!
//! SIMD register types are "newtype'd" so that better trait impls can be given
//! to them, but the inner value is a `pub` field so feel to just grab it out if
//! you need to. Trait impls of the newtypes include: `Default` (zeroed),
//! `From`/`Into` of appropriate data types, and appropriate operator
//! overloading.
//!
//! * Most intrinsics (like addition and multiplication) are totally safe to use
//!   as long as the CPU feature is available. In this case, what you get is 1:1
//!   with the actual intrinsic.
//! * Some intrinsics take a pointer of an assumed minimum alignment and
//!   validity span. For these, the `safe_arch` function takes a reference of an
//!   appropriate type to uphold safety.
//!   * Try the [bytemuck](https://docs.rs/bytemuck) crate (and turn on the
//!     `bytemuck` feature of this crate) if you want help safely casting
//!     between reference types.
//! * Some intrinsics are not safe unless you're _very_ careful about how you
//!   use them, such as the streaming operations requiring you to use them in
//!   combination with an appropriate memory fence. Those operations aren't
//!   exposed here.
//! * Some intrinsics mess with the processor state, such as changing the
//!   floating point flags, saving and loading special register state, and so
//!   on. LLVM doesn't really support you messing with that within a high level
//!   language, so those operations aren't exposed here. Use assembly or
//!   something if you want to do that.
//!
//! ## Naming Conventions
//! The actual names for each intrinsic are generally a flaming dumpster of
//! letters that only make sense _after_ you've learned all the names. They're
//! very bad for learning what things do. Accordingly, `safe_arch` uses very
//! verbose naming that (hopefully) improves the new-user experience.
//!
//! * Function names start with the primary "verb" of the operation, and then
//!   any adverbs go after that. This makes for slightly awkward English but
//!   helps the list of all the functions sort a little better.
//!   * Eg: `add_i32_m128i` and `add_i16_saturating_m128i`
//! * Function names end with the register type they're most associated with.
//!   * Eg: `and_m128` (for `m128`) and `and_m128d` (for `m128d`)
//! * If a function operates on just the lowest data lane it generally has `_s`
//!   after the register type, because it's a "scalar" operation. The higher
//!   lanes are generally just copied forward, or taken from a secondary
//!   argument, or something. Details vary.
//!   * Eg: `sqrt_m128` (all lanes) and `sqrt_m128_s` (low lane only)
//!
//! Of course, people can't even always agree on what words mean. The common
//! verb names for this crate, and their conventions, are as follows:
//! * `load`: Reads memory into a register (deref `&Foo` to `Foo`).
//! * `store`: Writes a register to memory (writes `Foo` to a `&mut Foo`).
//! * `set`: Packs values into a register (works like `[1, 2, 3, 4]` to build an
//!   array).
//! * `splat`: Copy a value as many times as possible across the bits of a
//!   register (works like `[1_i32; LEN]` array building).
//! * `extract`: Get an individual lane out of a SIMD register (works like array
//!   access). The lane to get has to be a const value.
//! * `insert`: Duplicate a register and then replace the value of a specific
//!   lane (works like `let mut a2 = a.clone(); a2[i] = new;`). The lane to
//!   overwrite has to be a const value.
//! * `cast`: change data types while preserving the bit pattern (like how
//!   `transmute` would do it).
//! * `convert`: change data types while trying to preserve the numeric value
//!   (which might change the bits, like how `as` would do it).
//!
//! **This crate is pre-1.0 and if you feel that an operation should have a
//! better name to improve the crate's consistency please file an issue.**
//!
//! ## Current Support
//! * Intel (`x86` / `x86_64`)
//!   * 128-bit: `sse`, `sse2`, `sse3`, `ssse3`, `sse4.1`, `sse4.2`
//!   * 256-bit: `avx`
//!   * Other: `adx`, `aes`, `bmi1`, `bmi2`, `lzcnt`, `pclmulqdq`, `popcnt`,
//!     `rdrand`, `rdseed`
//!
//! ## Compile Time CPU Target Features
//!
//! At the time of me writing this, Rust enables the `sse` and `sse2` CPU
//! features by default for all `i686` (x86) and `x86_64` builds. Those CPU
//! features are built into the design of `x86_64`, and you'd need a _super_ old
//! `x86` CPU for it to not support at least `sse` and `sse2`, so they're a safe
//! bet for the language to enable all the time. In fact, because the standard
//! library is compiled with them enabled, simply trying to _disable_ those
//! features would actually cause ABI issues and fill your program with UB
//! ([link][rustc_docs]).
//!
//! If you want additional CPU features available at compile time you'll have to
//! enable them with an additional arg to `rustc`. For a feature named `name`
//! you pass `-C target-feature=+name`, such as `-C target-feature=+sse3` for
//! `sse3`.
//!
//! You can alternately enable _all_ target features of the current CPU with `-C
//! target-cpu=native`. This is primarily of use if you're building a program
//! you'll only run on your own system.
//!
//! It's sometimes hard to know if your target platform will support a given
//! feature set, but the [Steam Hardware Survey][steam-survey] is generally
//! taken as a guide to what you can expect people to have available. If you
//! click "Other Settings" it'll expand into a list of CPU target features and
//! how common they are. These days, it seems that `sse3` can be safely assumed,
//! and `ssse3`, `sse4.1`, and `sse4.2` are pretty safe bets as well. The stuff
//! above 128-bit isn't as common yet, give it another few years.
//!
//! **Please note that executing a program on a CPU that doesn't support the
//! target features it was compiles for is Undefined Behavior.**
//!
//! Currently, Rust doesn't actually support an easy way for you to check that a
//! feature enabled at compile time is _actually_ available at runtime. There is
//! the "[feature_detected][feature_detected]" family of macros, but if you
//! enable a feature they will evaluate to a constant `true` instead of actually
//! deferring the check for the feature to runtime. This means that, if you
//! _did_ want a check at the start of your program, to confirm that all the
//! assumed features are present and error out when the assumptions don't hold,
//! you can't use that macro. You gotta use CPUID and check manually. rip.
//! Hopefully we can make that process easier in a future version of this crate.

//! ### A Note On Working With Cfg
//!
//! There's two main ways to use `cfg`:
//! * Via an attribute placed on an item, block, or expression:
//!   * `#[cfg(debug_assertions)] println!("hello");`
//! * Via a macro used within an expression position:
//!   * `if cfg!(debug_assertions) { println!("hello"); }`
//!
//! The difference might seem small but it's actually very important:
//! * The attribute form will include code or not _before_ deciding if all the
//!   items named and so forth really exist or not. This means that code that is
//!   configured via attribute can safely name things that don't always exist as
//!   long as the things they name do exist whenever that code is configured
//!   into the build.
//! * The macro form will include the configured code _no matter what_, and then
//!   the macro resolves to a constant `true` or `false` and the compiler uses
//!   dead code elimination to cut out the path not taken.
//!
//! This crate uses `cfg` via the attribute, so the functions it exposes don't
//! exist at all when the appropriate CPU target features aren't enabled.
//! Accordingly, if you plan to call this crate or not depending on what
//! features are enabled in the build you'll also need to control your use of
//! this crate via cfg attribute, not cfg macro.
